#There are homework guidelines for submitting each assignment

#Janaury 09 - Week 1 - Day 2

#Class names are written as:

#     pass

# class Student():
#     """
#     Student Class: Creates little students...
#     """
#     pricePerCredit = 1500

#         self.tuitionCost = credits * self.pricePerCredit
#         self.tuitionCost = credits * Student.pricePerCredit

#         # Why use a class variable ?
#         Student.num_of_students += 1

# print(student1.tuitionCost)
# student1.pricePerCredit = 1400
# student1.tuition()
# print(student1.tuitionCost)

# print(student1.tuitionCost)

# # Let's check the name space for our class and instances :
# print(Student.__dict__)
# print(student1.__dict__)

# # Make it more readable :
# for attr in Student.__dict__:
#     print(attr)

# for attr in student1.__dict__.values():
#     print(attr)
